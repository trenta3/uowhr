# Whole History Rating

A system for ranking game players by skill, based on RÃ©mi Coulom's [Whole History Rating](http://remi.coulom.free.fr/WHR/WHR.pdf) algorithm, with modifications to support handicaps.

Developed for use on [GoShrine](http://goshrine.com), but the code is not go specific.  It can support any two player game, as long as the outcome is a simple win/loss. 

Installation
------------

* gem install whole_history_rating


Usage
-----

    require 'whole_history_rating'
    
    @whr = WholeHistoryRating::Base.new
    
    # WholeHistoryRating::Base#create_game arguments: black player name, white player name, winner, day number, handicap
    # Handicap should generally be less than 500 elo
    @whr.create_game("shusaku", "shusai", "B", 1, 0)
    @whr.create_game("shusaku", "shusai", "W", 2, 0)
    @whr.create_game("shusaku", "shusai", "W", 3, 0)

    # Iterate the WHR algorithm towards convergence with more players/games, more iterations are needed.
    @whr.iterate(50)
    
    # Results are stored in one triplet for each day: [day_number, elo_rating, uncertainty]
    @whr.ratings_for_player("shusaku") => 
      [[1, -43, 84], 
       [2, -45, 84], 
       [3, -45, 84]]
    @whr.ratings_for_player("shusai") => 
      [[1, 43, 84], 
       [2, 45, 84], 
       [3, 45, 84]]



Optional Configuration
----------------------

One of the meta parameters to WHR is the variance of rating change over one time step, :w2,
which determines how much that a player's rating is likely change in one day.  Higher numbers allow for faster progress.
The default value is 300, which is fairly high.

    @whr = WholeHistoryRating::Base.new(:w2 => 17)
